shoppy, a simple script as a minimalist replacement for shopping list apps

input format: a single item per line txt file, details can be added trailing with a comma

ordering: edit the store-order.txt file with category names. might sound like a weird feature but try to shop from a huge supermarket, it comes in handy.

Note: Currently output format is txt since there are no lightweight/sensible/FOSS markdown previewer on android, since I use this mainly on my phone, I need easy edit access. There are not checklists currenly, just a plain text file with some artifacts of md formatting.
